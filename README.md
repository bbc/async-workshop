# Async workshop

> Asynchronous programming in Node

## Initial set up

* Get source
```bash
git clone git@github.com:bbc/async-workshop.git
```
* Ensure Node 8 is installed. 

## Workshop
This is a **self paced** workshop which allows developers to enhance asynchronous programming knowledge by solving coding challenges and refactoring applications/libraries. 

**This is not a tutorial or lecture based workshop**. However, the workshop will provide
references to any required resources.

## Instructions 
    * Read the questions carefully. 
    * Some exercises have tests but not all. Typically you don't need to worry about the tests unless instructed.  
    * DO NOT change the tests. Report any issues.
    * DO NOT cheat the tests (pointless) i.e return hardcoded values to make them pass. 
    * Use referenced resources for assistance.
    * Answer the questions in order
    * Work individually unless instructed (there is a pairing exercise)
