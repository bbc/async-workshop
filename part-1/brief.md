# Implementing asnychronous patterns

## Task

Implement an asynchrous util library called `asyncify` using Node 8. This library encapsulates
various asychronous patterns commonly used within iPlayer.

**It is not expected that you implement all functionality or write code of production quality for
this task**

## Instructions

* change directly to `part-1`
* `npm i`
* **Implement failing tests**. Carefully choose with functions you wish to implement.
* **Do not** install additional dependencies unless explicity instructed
* `lib/async.js` (and supporting functions) have been created methods for convenience (but no
  implemetation)
* If you create additional helper utils, **please create files in** `lib/private`.
* Tests **should not** require modifiction (please report bugs)
* Jest is used as a testing framework (facebook), which is similar to mocha. **Run tests with `npm
  test`**. Please see [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for further details.

## Ways of working

* Your choice but working as individuals is recommendated for this task.
