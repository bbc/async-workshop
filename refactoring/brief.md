# Refactoring to use async/await

## Task

In **pairs**, upgrade the following to use async/await (where appropriate):

* [consumer-contracts](https://github.com/bbc/consumer-contracts)
* [sqs-consumer](https://github.com/bbc/sqs-consumer)
* [sqs-producer](https://github.com/bbc/sqs-producer)
* Select a project of your choosing that requires an async/await upgrade 

You can treat the above as a dev exercise or make an official contribution (see contribution guidelines for the project).
