# Fundamentals

This section is a refresher on the basics of callbacks and promises. It will also introduce `async functions` and the `await` operator. 

See [Fundamentals](./fundamentals/questions.md)

# Patterns - Implementing asynchronous patterns

This section involves writing an async utility library called `asyncify`. The
functions that need be implementated are based on common usecases. e.g `.map`, `reduce`.

See [async patterns](./patterns/brief.md)

# Refactoring

⚠️  This is a pairing exercise ⚠️

In this section you'll refactor existing bbc libraries. There is a potential for open source contributions. 

See [refactoring](./refactoring/brief.md)

# Review

Finally, this section is concerned with knowledge sharing and how async/await/promises should be used within your team. 

See [review](./review/review.md)
